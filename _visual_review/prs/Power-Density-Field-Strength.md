# Visual Assessment: Power Density  Field Strength

**Chapter File:** `_latex/chapters/Power-Density-&-Field-Strength.tex`

## Assessment Required

@copilot Please perform a visual assessment of this chapter for:

1. **Overlapping text** - Check for text collisions with graphics, equations, or callout boxes
2. **Poor alignment** - Verify proper alignment of:
   - Equations and equation numbers
   - TikZ diagrams and captions
   - Tables and column alignment
   - Callout boxes and margins
3. **Graphics placement** - Ensure figures don't:
   - Overflow page margins
   - Split across page breaks inappropriately
   - Obscure important text
4. **Typography issues** - Check for:
   - Proper spacing around math symbols
   - Consistent font sizing in diagrams
   - Readable label positioning in TikZ graphics

## How to Assess

1. Build the book: `cd _latex && xelatex chimera-book.tex`
2. Open `chimera-book.pdf` and locate this chapter
3. Review each page visually
4. Identify specific line numbers in `chapters/Power-Density-&-Field-Strength.tex` that need fixes
5. Propose LaTeX corrections (adjust spacing, positioning, sizing)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No overlapping text or graphics
- [ ] All elements properly aligned within margins
- [ ] TikZ diagrams render cleanly with readable labels
- [ ] Equations positioned correctly with proper spacing
- [ ] Callout boxes don't collide with other elements
- [ ] Professional appearance matching BPSK exemplar standard

## Files to Modify

- `_latex/chapters/Power-Density-&-Field-Strength.tex`

**Priority:** Visual quality fix
**Estimated effort:** 15-30 minutes
