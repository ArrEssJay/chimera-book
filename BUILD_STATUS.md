# Build Status - October 10, 2025

## ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL

The Chimera book now builds completely without errors!

### Output Files Generated
- **chimera-book-print.pdf** - 562 pages, 4.0 MB (Color print version)
- **chimera-book-epdf.pdf** - 562 pages, 4.0 MB (Electronic distribution)
- **chimera-book.epub** - 2.7 MB (eBook format)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Chapter File Renaming (36 files)
All chapter files have been renamed to use filesystem-safe names:
- Removed special characters: `&`, `'`, parentheses `()`, commas `,`
- Replaced with hyphens and alphanumerics
- Example: `Maxwell's-Equations-&-Wave-Propagation.tex` → `Maxwells-Equations-and-Wave-Propagation.tex`

#### 2. Updated Manuscript
- Updated all `\input{}` commands in `chimera-book.tex` to reference new filenames
- Fixed LaTeX capacity overflow error caused by special characters
- All 69 chapters now included properly

#### 3. Commits Made
- `117d860` - Rename chapters to filesystem-safe names; update manuscript includes
- `b056092` - Fix missing FEC and Hamming Distance chapter renames

### Known Issues (Minor)
- Pandoc warnings for EPUB generation (expected, doesn't affect output quality)
- These are due to Pandoc's different parsing of LaTeX \input statements
- EPUB file still generates successfully

### Next Steps for Publication
1. Convert `chimera-book-print.pdf` to B/W using Adobe Preflight (for physical printing)
2. Use `chimera-book-epdf.pdf` for electronic distribution (already optimized)
3. Test `chimera-book.epub` on various eReaders
4. Upload to print-on-demand service (KDP, IngramSpark, etc.)

### Build Command
```bash
cd /Users/rowan/VSCode/chimera/book
./build-book.sh
```

Build time: ~5-10 minutes (depending on system)
