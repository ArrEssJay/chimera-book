# FSK Chapter Visual Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issue
Visual assessment and correction of the Frequency-Shift-Keying (FSK) chapter for:
- Overlapping text/graphics
- Alignment issues
- Graphics sizing/placement
- Typography problems

## Resolution
All visual issues have been successfully resolved through targeted LaTeX adjustments.

## Changes Applied

### 1. TikZ Diagrams - Size Optimization

**Modulator Diagram (lines 164-184)**
```diff
- block/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=2.2cm, minimum height=1cm, ...}
- node distance=2.2cm
+ block/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, ...}
+ node distance=2cm

Node spacing reductions:
- 2.8cm → 2.3cm (input to switch)
- 3.5cm → 2.8cm (switch to VCO)
- 3.2cm → 2.5cm (VCO to filter)
- 2.8cm → 2.3cm (filter to output)
```

**Non-Coherent Demodulator (lines 197-222)**
```diff
- block/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, ...}
- node distance=2cm
+ block/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=1.8cm, minimum height=0.9cm, ...}
+ node distance=1.8cm

Node spacing reductions:
- 2.8cm → 2.3cm (split distances)
- 2.8cm → 2.2cm (filter to detector)
- 2.5cm → 2cm (detector to sample, sample to output)
- yshift: -1.4cm → -1.15cm (comparator positioning)
```

**Coherent Demodulator (lines 240-268)**
```diff
- block/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, ...}
- node distance=2cm
+ block/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=1.8cm, minimum height=0.9cm, ...}
+ node distance=1.8cm

Similar spacing optimizations as non-coherent demodulator
```

### 2. Table Formatting

**Comparison Table (lines 322-334)**
```diff
\begin{center}
+\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
-\textbf{Scheme} & \textbf{Spectral Efficiency} & \textbf{$E_b/N_0$ @ BER $10^{-6}$} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{Detection} \\
+\textbf{Scheme} & \textbf{Spectral Eff.} & \textbf{$E_b/N_0$} & \textbf{Complex.} & \textbf{Detection} \\
+ & \textbf{(bps/Hz)} & \textbf{@ BER $10^{-6}$} & & \\
\midrule
-OOK & $\sim$0.5~bps/Hz & 13.5~dB & Low & Non-coherent \\
+OOK & $\sim$0.5 & 13.5~dB & Low & Non-coh. \\
```

### 3. Text Overflow Corrections

**Line 273:**
```diff
-Phase synchronization (approximately 1~dB improvement over non-coherent)
+Phase synchronization (approx.\ 1~dB improvement over non-coherent)
```

**Line 470:**
```diff
-\item \textbf{Wireless sensor networks:} Low-power nodes with simple FSK transceivers
+\item \textbf{Wireless sensor networks:} Low-power nodes with simple FSK trans\-ceiv\-ers
```

**Line 570:**
```diff
-\item \textbf{Chapter~12:} Constellation Diagrams---visualization of modulation schemes
+\item \textbf{Chapter~12:} Constellation Diagrams---modulation scheme visualization
```

## Compilation Results

### Before Fixes
```
Overfull \hbox (27.60062pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 183--184
Overfull \hbox (27.47427pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 221--222
Overfull \hbox (8.05865pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 273--274
Overfull \hbox (86.42308pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 322--334
Overfull \hbox (1.5517pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 397--398
Overfull \hbox (12.18051pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 468--469
Overfull \hbox (7.13176pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 568--569
```

### After Fixes
```
Overfull \hbox (1.5517pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 399--400
```

**Improvement:** 7 overfull boxes reduced to 1 negligible (1.55pt ≈ 0.5mm)
