# LDPC Codes

##  For Non-Technical Readers

**LDPC codes are like a super-smart spell-checker that can fix
corruption even when 40% of letters are garbled---and
they're so good, they're in your WiFi,
5G phone, and satellite TV!**

**The magic - Near-perfect error correction**: - **Regular
error correction**: Can fix maybe 10-20% errors - **LDPC**: Can fix
40%+ errors and get to near-theoretical limit! - **How**: Uses
“belief propagation” --- bits check each other iteratively

**Real-world analogy - Sudoku**: - Each bit is connected to
multiple parity checks - Like sudoku: each number constrains others -
Even if some numbers missing, you can solve for them! - LDPC does this
with thousands of interconnected checks

**Why they're everywhere**: - **WiFi 5/6**:
Uses LDPC for reliability - **5G phones**: LDPC for data channels
(not control) - **Satellite TV (DVB-S2)**: LDPC enables HD from
space - **Deep space**: NASA uses LDPC for Mars rovers -
**SSDs**: Flash storage uses LDPC to survive wear

**The history - Forgotten and rediscovered**: - **1962**:
Robert Gallager invents LDPC at MIT - **1960s-1990s**: Forgotten
(computers too slow to decode) - **1996**: Rediscovered! Now
computers are fast enough - **2000s**: Adopted in WiFi, satellites,
5G - **Today**: One of the best error correction codes!

**How good are they?** - **Shannon limit**: Theoretical best
possible (1948) - **LDPC performance**: Within 0.5 dB of Shannon
limit! - Translation: 99.9% of theoretical maximum efficiency - No
other practical code comes this close!

**Why “Low-Density Parity-Check”?** - **Parity-check**:
Error detection using math - **Low-density**: Each bit only checks
a few others (sparse) - **Benefit**: Efficient decoding (not
checking everything against everything)

**When you see it**: - **WiFi router**: “802.11ac” uses LDPC
codes - **5G phone specs**: “LDPC encoding for eMBB” -
**Satellite receiver**: “DVB-S2 with LDPC” - **SSD specs**:
“LDPC ECC engine”

**Fun fact**: LDPC codes were forgotten for 30 years because
computers in the 1960s couldn't run the decoder in
real-time. Today, your WiFi chip decodes LDPC billions of times per
second without breaking a sweat!

**Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)** codes are a class of
\[\[Forward-Error-Correction-(FEC)FEC\]\] codes used in
Chimera and many modern communication systems.

## What Makes LDPC Special?

1.  **Near Shannon-limit performance**: Approaches theoretical
    maximum efficiency

2.  **Iterative decoding**: Uses belief propagation algorithm

3.  **Flexible**: Configurable code rate and structure

4.  **Widely adopted**: Found in WiFi, satellite, 5G, storage systems

## History

- **1962**: Invented by Robert Gallager (MIT)

- **1960s-1990s**: Forgotten (too complex for the technology)

- **1996**: Rediscovered by MacKay and Neal

- **2000s+**: Adopted in modern standards (computational power now
  sufficient)

## How LDPC Works

### The Parity-Check Matrix

LDPC uses a **sparse parity-check matrix** H: - Most entries are 0
(hence “low-density”) - Few entries are 1 - Defines parity
relationships between bits

    Example 3x6 LDPC matrix H:

         b b b b b b
    p [ 1  1  0  1  0  0 ]   b  b  b = 0
    p [ 0  1  1  0  1  0 ]   b  b  b = 0
    p [ 1  0  0  1  0  1 ]   b  b  b = 0

    Where  is XOR (modulo-2 addition)

### Encoding

    Information bits:  [1 0 1 0]
             
    LDPC Encoder: Apply H matrix
             
    Codeword:     [1 0 1 0 1 1]
                  +-----+ +---+
                   data   parity

### Decoding (Belief Propagation)

The decoder iteratively refines bit estimates:

1.  **Initialize**: Start with received soft values (not just 0/1)

2.  **Check nodes**: Verify parity constraints

3.  **Variable nodes**: Update bit estimates

4.  **Iterate**: Repeat until convergence or max iterations

5.  **Decide**: Hard decision on final bit values

<!-- -->

    Iteration:  1    2    3    ... 50
    Errors:    15  8  3   ... 0  

## LDPC Parameters

### Code Rate

    Rate = k/n

    where:
    - k = number of information bits
    - n = total codeword length

Common rates in Chimera: - **1/2**: Strong error correction (50%
overhead) - **2/3**: Balanced (33% overhead) - **3/4**:
Efficient (25% overhead)

### Block Length

- Longer blocks: Better performance but more latency

- Typical: 576 to 8192 bits

- Chimera: Configurable per preset

### Degree Distribution

- **Variable node degree**: Connections per information bit

- **Check node degree**: Connections per parity bit

- **Optimized**: For specific code rates and SNR ranges

## Performance Characteristics

### Waterfall Region

    BER
     
    10 |
        |     Steep
    10³ |      drop!
        |        
    10 |         +
        |          +___
    10 |              +___
        +------------------ SNR (dB)
           Threshold

### Threshold Effect

- Below threshold: BER stays high

- At threshold: BER drops rapidly (waterfall)

- Above threshold: Approaches error floor

### Error Floor

- Minimum achievable BER

- Caused by:

  - Trapping sets (problematic bit patterns)

  - Finite block length

  - Decoder implementation limits

## LDPC in Chimera

### Implementation Details

- **Library**: Uses `chimera-core` Rust implementation

- **Decoder**: Iterative belief propagation

- **Max iterations**: Configurable (typically 50)

- **Soft decision**: Uses log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)

### Preset Configuration

Each Chimera preset specifies: - Code rate (e.g., 1/2, 2/3) - Block
length - Parity matrix structure - Recommended SNR range

### Performance Metrics

- **Pre-FEC BER**: Before LDPC decoding

- **Post-FEC BER**: After LDPC correction

- **Iterations**: Average iterations to converge

- **Frame failures**: Frames that couldn't be
  corrected

## Example: LDPC in Action

    Scenario:
    - SNR: -18 dB (very noisy!)
    - Code rate: 1/2
    - Block length: 1024 bits

    Without LDPC:
    - Pre-FEC BER: 4.5 × 10² (4.5% errors)
    - Message: Completely corrupted 

    With LDPC:
    - Decoder iterations: 35
    - Post-FEC BER: 0 (zero errors!)
    - Message: Perfect recovery! 

    Coding gain: ~40 dB

## Real-World Applications
