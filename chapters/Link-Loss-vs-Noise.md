# Link Loss vs Noise

##  For Non-Technical Readers

**Link loss vs noise is like the difference between someone
whispering (weak signal) vs shouting in a loud room (noise
interference)---two different problems!**

**Link Loss** - Signal gets weaker: - **What it is**: Your
WiFi router is far away, so signal is weak by the time it reaches you -
**Analogy**: Shouting across a football field---your voice
spreads out and gets quieter - **Predictable**: Same distance =
same loss every time - **Solution**: Move closer, use bigger
antenna, increase transmit power

**Examples of link loss**: - **WiFi**: 50 meters away =
10,000\$\times\$ weaker signal - **Cell phone**: Far
from tower = fewer bars - **Satellite**: Space is far! Signal
arrives incredibly weak

**Noise** - Random interference added: - **What it is**:
Random electrical static from electronics, thermal energy, cosmic rays -
**Analogy**: Trying to hear someone whisper in a noisy
restaurant---extra sound covers the signal - **Random**:
Unpredictable, changes moment-to-moment - **Solution**:
Can't remove it! Must send stronger signal or use error
correction

**Examples of noise**: - **Bluetooth stuttering near
microwave**: Microwave adds noise - **AM radio crackle**:
Thunderstorms add noise - **TV static**: No signal?
You're seeing pure noise!

**Key difference**: - **Link loss**: Makes signal weaker
(deterministic, predictable) - **Noise**: Adds random garbage on
top (random, unpredictable) - **Both hurt you**: Weak signal (loss)
covered by noise = errors!

**The engineering ratio: SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** - Strong
signal + low noise = high SNR = perfect communication - Weak signal
(loss) + high noise = low SNR = errors everywhere

**When you see it**: Your phone shows “5 bars” (link loss is low)
but internet is slow (noise is high from interference).

In a real communication system, the received signal is degraded by
**two distinct mechanisms**: link loss and additive noise.

## Link Loss (Path Loss)

**Link Loss** represents the reduction in signal power as it
travels from transmitter to receiver.

### Characteristics

- **Deterministic**: Same loss every time (for a given scenario)

- **Multiplicative**: Scales the entire signal uniformly

- **Predictable**: Can be calculated from path distance, frequency,
  antenna gains

### Sources

- Free-space path loss

- Antenna gains (TX and RX)

- Cable losses

- Atmospheric absorption

- Rain attenuation

### Mathematical Model

    P_received = P_transmitted / Loss_Factor

    In dB: P_received (dBm) = P_transmitted (dBm) - Link_Loss (dB)

### Example Link Budget

    Transmit Power:        +30 dBm
    Antenna Gain (TX):     +10 dB
    Free-Space Loss:       -120 dB
    Antenna Gain (RX):     +5 dB
    Cable/Implementation:  -5 dB
    -----------------------------
    Received Signal Power: -80 dBm
    Total Link Loss:       100 dB

## Additive Noise

**Noise** adds random fluctuations on top of the received signal.

### Characteristics

- **Random**: Different every time, unpredictable

- **Additive**: Added to the signal (not multiplicative)

- **Stochastic**: Described by statistical properties (power,
  distribution)

### Sources

- Thermal noise (kTB)

- Amplifier noise

- Cosmic background

- Interference from other signals

### Mathematical Model

    Received Signal = (Transmitted Signal / Link_Loss) + Noise

    where Noise has power determined by SNR or N

## Combined Channel Model

In Chimera's simulation, both effects are applied:

    1. Transmit Signal (Power = P_tx)
            
    2. Apply Link Loss (Power reduced to P_tx / 10^(Loss_dB/10))
            
    3. Add AWGN (Noise power = Attenuated_Signal_Power / SNR)
            
    4. Received Signal (Attenuated + Noisy)

## Why Both Matter

### Link Loss Affects Signal Power

- High link loss (100+ dB) is typical in many systems

- Reduces signal level but doesn't add randomness

- Can be compensated with amplification (but amplifies noise too!)

### Noise Affects Signal Quality (SNR)

- Adds random errors that can't be predicted

- Sets the fundamental limit on achievable BER

- Can be improved with processing gain, error correction

## Link Budget and SNR

The combination determines receiver performance:

    Received Signal Power = P_tx - Link_Loss_dB
    Noise Power = N × Bandwidth

    SNR (dB) = Received_Signal_Power (dBm) - Noise_Power (dBm)

### Example 1: Good Link

- Transmit power: +30 dBm

- Link loss: 100 dB

- Received signal: **-70 dBm**

- Noise floor: -90 dBm

- **Resulting SNR: 20 dB** Good!

### Example 2: Challenging Link

- Transmit power: +30 dBm

- Link loss: 120 dB

- Received signal: **-90 dBm**

- Noise floor: -90 dBm

- **Resulting SNR: 0 dB** Very challenging!

## Link Loss in Chimera

Chimera allows you to model link loss separately from SNR: -
**Link Loss**: Simulates the signal power reduction (path loss,
antenna gains, etc.) - **SNR**: Controls the additive noise level -
Both combine to determine the received signal quality - This separation
helps understand link budget analysis

With **0 dB link loss**, the SNR setting directly determines signal
quality.

With **100 dB link loss**, the signal is attenuated by
10\textsuperscript{1}\textsuperscript{0},
but the SNR still controls the noise-to-signal ratio at the receiver
input.

## Key Insight

    More TX Power  Overcomes Link Loss  Higher RX Power  Better SNR
                                                                  
                                                          Lower BER 

But there are practical limits: - Transmitter power constraints
(battery, regulations) - Receiver sensitivity (noise floor) - Cost and
complexity
