## Overview

The **Frey microwave auditory effect** (also called
**microwave hearing** or **RF hearing**) is the perception of
auditory sensations (clicks, buzzes, or tones) when exposed to
**pulsed microwave radiation** (typically 1-10 GHz). The effect is
well-documented and occurs **without external sound**---the
perception arises from **thermoelastic expansion** in the cochlea.

**Key features** : - Requires **pulsed** microwaves (CW
ineffective) - Perceived sound frequency ~pulse
repetition rate (not microwave carrier frequency) - Threshold:
~1-10
\$\mu\$J/cm\textsuperscript{2} per pulse
(very low energy) - Mechanism: Rapid heating
\$\rightarrow\$ acoustic pressure wave
\$\rightarrow\$ cochlear stimulation

**Applications** (potential ): - Non-lethal weapons (“active
denial” communication) - Assistive hearing devices (cochlear implant
alternative?) - Covert communication

## Simple Explanation (For Non-Technical Readers) 

### What Is It?

Imagine hearing sounds---clicks, buzzes, or even tones---but
there's no speaker, no headphones, and no actual sound
waves in the air. That's the Frey microwave auditory
effect.

When certain types of microwave signals (like what's in
a radar) are pulsed rapidly on and off, people near them sometimes hear
mysterious noises. It's not science
fiction---it's a real, well-studied phenomenon
discovered in the 1960s.

### How Does It Work? (The Simple Version)

Think of it like this:

1.  **Microwave pulses hit your head** (don't
    worry---very tiny amounts of energy, much less than a microwave
    oven)

2.  **They make tissue heat up just a tiny, tiny bit**
    (we're talking millionths of a degree---you
    can't feel it)

3.  **That tiny heating happens so fast it makes the tissue expand
    suddenly** (like how metal expands when heated, but much faster)

4.  **The expansion creates a pressure wave** (basically a tiny
    “pop” inside your head)

5.  **That pressure wave reaches your inner ear** (the cochlea)

6.  **Your ear detects it as sound** (your brain thinks “I heard a
    click!”)

It's like tapping on a microphone to test
it---except the “tap” comes from inside your head, caused by
invisible microwaves.

### Key Points to Remember

**It's safe (at normal levels)** - The energy
levels that cause the effect are far below what would harm you -
It's like hearing a distant whisper---noticeable but
not dangerous - No tissue damage occurs at the levels needed to hear the
sound

**It's not mind control** - Despite what conspiracy
theories say, this effect only creates sounds - It can't
implant thoughts or control your actions - It's no
different from hearing any other sound with your ears

**Your cell phone can't do this** - Cell phones use
continuous signals, not rapid pulses - They don't have
enough power (need kilowatts, not milliwatts) - The frequency
isn't quite right for the effect

**Why you might care:** - It's a fascinating
example of how physics and biology interact - It shows our bodies can be
“antennas” for certain signals - It has potential uses (and misuses)
in technology and defense

### The “Wow” Factor

The coolest part? **The sound isn't “out
there”---it's created inside your head.** Someone
standing right next to you won't hear it. But you will.
It's your own personal acoustic experience, generated by
electromagnetic waves.

Scientists have even used this to transmit simple speech
patterns---imagine hearing words that no one spoke, with no device
in your ear. That's the Frey effect in action.

## 1. Discovery and Historical Background

### 1.1 Allan Frey's Experiments (1962)

**Original observation**: Frey reported that humans near radar
installations heard “clicking” or “buzzing” sounds synchronized with
radar pulses.

**Controlled experiment**: - Subjects exposed to pulsed microwaves
(1.3 GHz, ~10 \$\mu\$s pulses, 100-1000 pps)
- Auditory perception reported even in **deaf subjects**
(conductive hearing loss; sensorineural deaf individuals did not
perceive) - Sound localized to head, not external space

**Frey's conclusion**: Microwaves directly
stimulate auditory system, bypassing external ear.

**Controversy**: Initial skepticism; effect dismissed as equipment
artifact (electromagnetic interference with auditory nerves). Later
confirmed by multiple independent labs.

### 1.2 Subsequent Research (1970s-1990s)

**U.S. military studies** (classified then declassified): -
Confirmed Frey effect in animals and humans - Explored for communication
(“voice-to-skull”) and non-lethal weapons

**Key findings**: - Effect requires intact cochlea (direct neural
stimulation ruled out) - Perceived frequency matches pulse repetition
rate (10 pps \$\rightarrow\$ 10 Hz perceived tone) - Peak
sensitivity ~2.45 GHz (ISM band)

## 2. Mechanism: Thermoelastic Expansion

### 2.1 Physical Process

**Step 1: Microwave absorption** - Pulsed microwave energy absorbed
by tissue (primarily water) - Absorption depth (1/e): ~1-3
cm at 1-10 GHz

**Step 2: Rapid heating** - Pulse duration: ~1-10
\$\mu\$s (shorter than thermal diffusion time
~1 ms) - Temperature rise: $`\Delta T \approx 10^{-6}`$ to
$`10^{-5}`$ \$^\circ\$C per pulse (tiny!)

**Step 3: Thermoelastic expansion** - Heated tissue expands:
$`\Delta V/V = 3\alpha \Delta T`$ (where
$`\alpha \approx 3 \times 10^{-4}`$
K\textsuperscript{-}\textsuperscript{1}
is thermal expansion coefficient) - Expansion occurs on timescale of
pulse (~\$\mu\$s)
\$\rightarrow\$ **launches acoustic wave**

**Step 4: Acoustic propagation** - Pressure wave propagates through
head tissue to cochlea - Inner ear hair cells (stereocilia) detect
pressure \$\rightarrow\$ neural signal

**Step 5: Perception** - Auditory cortex processes signal
\$\rightarrow\$ perceived as sound

### 2.2 Quantitative Model

**Absorbed energy per pulse**:
``` math
E = \text{SAR} \times \tau \times m
```
where: - SAR: Specific
absorption rate (W/kg) - $`\tau`$: Pulse duration (s) - $`m`$: Mass of
absorbing tissue (kg)

**Temperature rise**:
``` math
\Delta T = \frac{E}{c_p m} = \frac{\text{SAR} \times \tau}{c_p}
```
where $`c_p \approx 3600`$ J/kg/K (specific heat capacity).

**For SAR = 1 W/kg, $`\tau = 1`$ \$\mu\$s**:
``` math
\Delta T = \frac{1 \times 10^{-6}}{3600} \approx 3 \times 10^{-10} \text{ K} \quad (\text{negligible heating!})
```

**Pressure amplitude** (Lin & Wang model):
``` math
p = \frac{\beta}{\rho_0 c_p} \cdot \text{SAR} \cdot \tau \cdot f_c
```
where: - $`\beta`$: Thermal expansion coefficient
(~$`10^{-4}`$
K\textsuperscript{-}\textsuperscript{1})
- $`\rho_0`$: Density (~1000
kg/m\textsuperscript{3}) - $`f_c`$: Microwave frequency
(Hz)

**Threshold pressure** for hearing: ~20
\$\mu\$Pa (0 dB SPL)

**Implication**: Very low energy pulses sufficient to exceed
hearing threshold.

### 2.3 Why Pulsed, Not CW?

**CW microwaves**: Steady heating \$\rightarrow\$ no
rapid expansion \$\rightarrow\$ no acoustic wave

**Pulsed microwaves**: Rapid on-off \$\rightarrow\$
expansion-contraction cycles \$\rightarrow\$ acoustic
transient

**Pulse duration**: Must be shorter than thermal diffusion time
(~1 ms) and comparable to acoustic period
(~10 \$\mu\$s for 100 kHz).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</div>

## 3. Experimental Evidence

### 3.1 Human Psychophysics

**Threshold measurements** (Guy et al., 1975): - Frequency range:
200 MHz - 10 GHz - Peak sensitivity: **2.45 GHz** (coincides with
peak brain absorption) - Threshold: ~1-10
\$\mu\$J/cm\textsuperscript{2} per pulse
(0.1-1 mW/cm\textsuperscript{2} average for 1% duty
cycle)

**Perceived sound characteristics**: - **Click**: Single pulse
- **Buzz**: Pulse train (10-100 pps) - **Tone**: High pulse
rate (\>1000 pps), perceived pitch = PRF - **No sound**:
CW exposure (even at high power)

**Deaf subjects**: Conductively deaf individuals (middle ear
damage) perceive effect; sensorineural deaf (cochlear damage) do not
\$\rightarrow\$ confirms cochlear origin.

### 3.2 Animal Studies

**Cochlear microphonics** (Elder & Chou, 2003): - Microelectrode
in guinea pig cochlea - Pulsed microwaves \$\rightarrow\$
electrical signal matching pulse rate - Signal abolished by cochlear
destruction \$\rightarrow\$ direct evidence for cochlear
transduction

**Auditory brainstem response** (ABR): - EEG-like measurement of
auditory pathway activity - Pulsed microwaves evoke ABR similar to
acoustic clicks

### 3.3 Simulations and Modeling

**Lin (1978)**: Developed thermoelastic theory; predicted threshold
within factor of 2-3 of measured values.

**Foster & Finch (1974)**: Showed calculated pressure waves
consistent with psychophysical thresholds.

**Consensus**: Thermoelastic mechanism **firmly established**
.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</div>

## 4. Frequency and Pulse Parameter Dependence

### 4.1 Carrier Frequency

**Optimal frequency**: 1-10 GHz - **Lower (\<100
MHz)**: Penetrates too deeply, low absorption in head
\$\rightarrow\$ weak effect - **Higher
(\>30 GHz)**: Absorbed at skin surface, doesn't
reach cochlea

**Peak sensitivity** ~2.45 GHz: Balance between
penetration and absorption.

### 4.2 Pulse Duration

**Optimal range**: 1-100 \$\mu\$s - **Shorter
(\<1 \$\mu\$s)**: Lower total energy, weaker
acoustic wave - **Longer (\>1 ms)**: Heat diffuses before
expansion \$\rightarrow\$ less efficient pressure
generation

### 4.3 Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)

**PRF determines perceived pitch**: - 10 Hz
\$\rightarrow\$ low hum - 100 Hz
\$\rightarrow\$ buzz - 1 kHz \$\rightarrow\$
audible tone - 10 kHz \$\rightarrow\$ high-pitched whistle

**Audible range**: 20 Hz - 20 kHz (same as acoustic hearing)

### 4.4 Peak Power vs. Average Power

**Key insight**: Effect depends on **peak power per pulse**,
not average power.

**Example**: - Pulse: 1 kW peak, 1 \$\mu\$s duration,
100 pps - Average power: $`1000 \times 10^{-6} \times 100 = 0.1`$ W
(weak!) - But peak intensity high enough to trigger effect

**Safety implication**: Average power density can be below safety
limits while still causing perception.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</div>

## 5. Safety Considerations

### 5.1 Exposure Limits

**IEEE/ICNIRP guidelines**: Based on thermal effects (tissue
heating) - **Occupational**: ~10
mW/cm\textsuperscript{2} (averaged over 6 minutes) -
**General public**: ~2
mW/cm\textsuperscript{2}

**Frey effect threshold**: ~1
\$\mu\$J/cm\textsuperscript{2} per pulse -
For 1 \$\mu\$s pulse at 100 pps (0.01% duty cycle):
Average = $`1 \times 10^{-6} \times 100 = 10^{-4}`$
J/cm\textsuperscript{2}/s = **0.01
mW/cm\textsuperscript{2}** - **Well below safety
limits**

**Conclusion**: Frey effect can occur at exposures considered safe
for thermal damage.

### 5.2 Health Effects

**Acute**: - Auditory perception (transient, reversible) -
Annoyance, distraction - No tissue damage at threshold levels

**Chronic**: - No known long-term effects from brief exposures -
High-intensity repeated exposure could cause cochlear damage (acoustic
trauma-like)

**Comparison to acoustic hearing**: Frey effect pressure waves
~60-80 dB SPL equivalent (moderate loudness, not
hazardous).

## 6. Applications (Potential )

### 6.1 Non-Lethal Weapons / Deterrents

**Concept**: Direct pulsed microwaves at target
\$\rightarrow\$ induce disorienting sounds (“voice in
head”)

**Advantages**: - No physical projectile - Reversible effect - Can
encode information (modulate PRF to transmit speech)

**Challenges**: - Requires high peak power (kW)
\$\rightarrow\$ bulky equipment - Line-of-sight only
(microwaves don't penetrate walls at GHz) - Ethical
concerns (psychological effects of “voices”)

**Status**: Prototypes exist (U.S. military “MEDUSA” system);
deployment unclear.

### 6.2 Assistive Hearing Devices

**Concept**: For sensorineural deaf (damaged hair cells), bypass
cochlea with direct microwave stimulation of auditory nerve.

**Problem**: Cochlear damage also eliminates microwave effect
(relies on intact cochlea).

**Alternative**: Cochlear implants (electrical stimulation) are
more effective.

### 6.3 Covert Communication

**Concept**: Transmit speech via modulated microwave pulses
\$\rightarrow\$ target hears without nearby listeners.

**Challenge**: Requires target to be stationary (beam focusing);
speech intelligibility limited by PRF bandwidth (~10 kHz
max).

### 6.4 Scientific Tool

**Brain imaging**: Could microwave pulses selectively activate
auditory cortex for fMRI mapping?

**Status**: Not pursued (ethical/safety barriers).

## 7. Comparison to Other Phenomena

### 7.1 Acoustic Heterodyning

**Different**: Heterodyning mixes two acoustic waves; Frey effect
is **EM-to-acoustic transduction**.

**Similarity**: Both create sound “from nothing” (no external
source).

**See**: \[\[Acoustic-Heterodyning\]\]

### 7.2 THz Bioeffects

**THz frequencies** (0.1-10 THz) are
~100-1000\$\times\$ higher than Frey effect
microwaves (GHz).

**Could THz cause similar effect?** - **No**: THz absorbed at
skin (\<1 mm penetration), never reaches cochlea. - Frey effect
requires **volumetric heating in brain tissue** near cochlea.

**See**: \[\[THz-Bioeffects-Thermal-and-Non-Thermal\]\]

## 8. Controversies and Misconceptions

### 8.1 “Mind Control” and Conspiracy Theories

**Misconception**: Frey effect can implant thoughts or control
behavior.

**Reality**: Effect only creates auditory perception; cannot write
information directly to brain. No different from hearing a sound via
ears.

### 8.2 “Havana Syndrome”

**Speculation**: Unexplained health incidents (2016-present)
involving U.S. diplomats attributed to “sonic attacks” or directed
energy weapons.

**Possible explanations**: - Pulsed microwaves (Frey effect) -
Ultrasound - Mass psychogenic illness

**Scientific consensus**: Mechanism unproven; microwave explanation
plausible but not confirmed.

### 8.3 5G and Cell Phones

**Question**: Can 5G towers or cell phones cause Frey effect?

**Answer**: **No** - Cell signals are CW or quasi-CW (not
short pulses) - Power too low (milliwatts vs. kilowatts needed) -
Frequency wrong (5G uses 3-30 GHz; sub-optimal for deep penetration)
