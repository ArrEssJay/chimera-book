# Energy Ratios: Es/N0 and Eb/N0

##  For Non-Technical Readers

**Es/N0 and Eb/N0 are like measuring “signal per bit of
information” vs “background noise”---higher ratio = cleaner
signal = fewer errors!**

**The idea - Signal vs Noise ratios**: - **Signal energy**:
How much “juice” each bit/symbol has - **Noise**: Random
interference (always present) - **Ratio**: Signal energy divided by
noise = quality measure!

**Two related measurements**:

**1. Eb/N0 (Energy per BIT)**: - How much energy in each individual
bit? - **Higher Eb/N0** = more energy per bit = easier to detect
correctly - Used to compare different systems fairly

**2. Es/N0 (Energy per SYMBOL)**: - How much energy in each symbol
(which may carry multiple bits)? - QPSK symbol carries 2 bits, so Es/N0
= 2 \$\times\$ Eb/N0 - Used for actual system performance
calculations

**Why it matters - Quality threshold**: - **Low Eb/N0** (weak
signal): Many bit errors, unusable - **Medium Eb/N0**: Some errors,
FEC can fix them - **High Eb/N0** (strong signal): Nearly
error-free

**Real-world example**: - **WiFi close to router**: Eb/N0 = 25
dB \$\rightarrow\$ use 256-QAM (fast!) - **WiFi far
from router**: Eb/N0 = 10 dB \$\rightarrow\$ use QPSK
(reliable!) - **WiFi too far**: Eb/N0 = 5 dB
\$\rightarrow\$ connection drops

**The relationship**:

    Es/N0 = Eb/N0 × (bits per symbol)

- BPSK: 1 bit/symbol \$\rightarrow\$ Es/N0 = Eb/N0

- QPSK: 2 bits/symbol \$\rightarrow\$ Es/N0 = 2
  \$\times\$ Eb/N0

- 16-QAM: 4 bits/symbol \$\rightarrow\$ Es/N0 = 4
  \$\times\$ Eb/N0

**Why engineers love Eb/N0**: - **Fair comparison**: Compares
systems with different modulations - **Theory matches practice**:
Theoretical limits use Eb/N0 - **Standards use it**: 3GPP, WiFi
specs quote Eb/N0 requirements

**When you see it**: - **Satellite link budget**: “Requires
10 dB Eb/N0 for BER \<
10\textsuperscript{-}\textsuperscript{6}”
- **Modem spec sheet**: “Sensitivity: -95 dBm at 8 dB Eb/N0” -
**Paper comparing modulations**: Always uses Eb/N0 for fair
comparison!

**Fun fact**: The theoretical minimum Eb/N0 for error-free
communication is -1.59 dB (Shannon limit)---but real systems need
5-15 dB due to practical limitations!

These ratios are fundamental measures of signal quality in digital
communications.

## Es/N0: Symbol Energy Ratio

**Es/N0** measures the energy per symbol relative to the noise
power spectral density.

- **Es**: Energy per symbol

- **N0**: Noise power per Hz (noise spectral density)

- Used when analyzing symbol-level performance

## Eb/N0: Bit Energy Ratio

**Eb/N0** measures the energy per bit relative to the noise power
spectral density.

- **Eb**: Energy per bit  

- **N0**: Noise power per Hz

- More fundamental measure for comparing different modulation schemes

## Relationship Between Es/N0 and Eb/N0

The relationship depends on how many bits per symbol:

    For QPSK (2 bits/symbol):
    Eb/N0 = Es/N0 - 3.01 dB

    General formula:
    Eb/N0 (dB) = Es/N0 (dB) - 10·log(bits per symbol)

## Example in Chimera

- If Channel Es/N0 = -15 dB

- For QPSK (2 bits/symbol):

- Then Eb/N0 = -15 dB - 3.01 dB = **-18.01 dB**

## Why These Ratios Matter

1.  **Performance Comparison**: Allows fair comparison between
    different modulation schemes

2.  **Link Budget Analysis**: Essential for designing communication
    systems

3.  **BER Prediction**: Theoretical BER curves are plotted against
    Eb/N0

4.  **Standard Metric**: Industry-standard way to specify
    communication system performance

## Comparison Table

| Modulation | Bits/Symbol | Es/N0 to Eb/N0 Conversion   |
|:-----------|:------------|:----------------------------|
| BPSK       | 1           | Eb/N0 = Es/N0 (0 dB)        |
| **QPSK**   | **2**       | **Eb/N0 = Es/N0 - 3.01 dB** |
| 8PSK       | 3           | Eb/N0 = Es/N0 - 4.77 dB     |
| 16QAM      | 4           | Eb/N0 = Es/N0 - 6.02 dB     |

## SNR vs Es/N0 vs Eb/N0

These terms are related but distinct:

- **SNR**: Ratio of signal power to noise power (may include
  bandwidth effects)

- **Es/N0**: Symbol energy to noise spectral density (symbol-level
  metric)

- **Eb/N0**: Bit energy to noise spectral density (bit-level
  metric, most fundamental)

In many contexts (including Chimera's simple channel
model), **SNR \$\approx\$ Es/N0**.
