# IQ Representation

##  For Non-Technical Readers

**IQ representation is like describing a location on a map using X
and Y coordinates---it lets you pinpoint any radio signal position
in 2D space!**

**What is IQ?** - **I (In-phase)**: Horizontal axis, like
“East-West” on a map - **Q (Quadrature)**: Vertical axis, like
“North-South” on a map - Together: Any point in 2D = any signal you
can send!

**Why two dimensions?** - Radio waves have **amplitude**
(strength) AND **phase** (timing) - Phase is like “what part of
the wave cycle are you at?” - Two dimensions let you control BOTH
simultaneously

**Real-world analogy - Clock hands**: - **12
o'clock position**: I = max, Q = 0 - **3
o'clock position**: I = 0, Q = max  
- **6 o'clock position**: I = -max, Q = 0 -
**9 o'clock position**: I = 0, Q = -max - Any angle
= unique IQ coordinate!

**Why it's everywhere**: - **Software Defined
Radio (SDR)**: All processing uses IQ data - **Digital audio**:
Left/Right channels \$\rightarrow\$ I/Q channels -
**Your phone**: Baseband chip outputs IQ samples, radio transmits
them - **WiFi chips**: Process IQ data to decode constellations

**The magic trick**: - One wire carries I signal, another carries Q
signal - At transmitter: Combine using 90\$^\circ\$
phase-shifted carriers - At receiver: Split using
90\$^\circ\$ phase-shifted carriers - Result: Two
independent data channels on same frequency!

**Fun fact**: IQ representation is why “quadrature” modulation
(QPSK, QAM) is so efficient---you're using two
perpendicular dimensions, doubling capacity compared to just varying
amplitude!

Each QPSK symbol is represented as a point in 2D space with two
components:

- **I (In-phase)**: The horizontal component (real part)

- **Q (Quadrature)**: The vertical component (imaginary part)

## What is I/Q?

**I** and **Q** are the two orthogonal (perpendicular)
components of a modulated signal. They're called: -
**In-phase** (I): Aligned with the carrier wave -
**Quadrature** (Q): 90\$^\circ\$ out of phase with
the carrier wave

## Mathematical Representation

Any modulated signal can be expressed as:

    Signal(t) = I(t)·cos(2ft) - Q(t)·sin(2ft)

Where: - `f` is the carrier frequency - `I(t)` is the
in-phase amplitude - `Q(t)` is the quadrature amplitude

## Complex Number Notation

In DSP, we often use complex number notation:

    Symbol = I + jQ

Where `j` is the imaginary unit (\$\sqrt{}\$-1)

### QPSK Example

For normalized QPSK symbols:

| Bits | I      | Q      | Complex       | Phase         |
|:-----|:-------|:-------|:--------------|:--------------|
|      | -0.707 | +0.707 | -0.707+j0.707 | 135\$^\circ\$ |
| 01   | +0.707 | +0.707 | +0.707+j0.707 | 45\$^\circ\$  |
| 11   | -0.707 | -0.707 | -0.707-j0.707 | 225\$^\circ\$ |
| 10   | +0.707 | -0.707 | +0.707-j0.707 | 315\$^\circ\$ |

## Why Use I/Q?

1.  **Efficient Processing**: Easy to implement in digital
    hardware/software

2.  **Phase and Amplitude**: Naturally represents both
    characteristics

3.  **Orthogonality**: I and Q don't interfere with
    each other

4.  **Standard Format**: Universal in modern communications

## I/Q in Chimera

Chimera's constellation diagrams plot: - **X-axis
(horizontal)**: I component - **Y-axis (vertical)**: Q component

When you see a dot at position (I=0.707, Q=0.707), that represents the
QPSK symbol for bits `01`.

## Adding Noise

When \[\[Additive-White-Gaussian-Noise-(AWGN)\]\] is added:

    I_received = I_transmitted + N_I
    Q_received = Q_transmitted + N_Q

Where `N_I` and `N_Q` are independent Gaussian random
variables. This is why you see **clouds** instead of
**points** in the RX constellation!
