# What Are Symbols?

##  For Non-Technical Readers

**A symbol is like a “word” in radio language---instead of
sending individual letters (bits), you send whole words (symbols) to go
faster!**

**The idea**: - **Bit**: Single 0 or 1 (like one letter) -
**Symbol**: Group of bits (like a whole word) - **Why**:
Sending “words” is faster than spelling letter-by-letter!

**Simple analogy - Semaphore flags**:

**Sending bit-by-bit**: - Flag up = 1 - Flag down = 0 - Message
“HI” (8 bits): Up, down, down, down, up, down, down, up - Takes 8
“signals”

**Sending symbol-by-symbol**: - 4 flag positions = 1 symbol = 2
bits! - Up-right = “00” - Up-left = “01” - Down-left = “10”  
- Down-right = “11” - Message “HI” (8 bits
\$\rightarrow\$ 4 symbols): - Takes only 4 “signals” =
**2\$\times\$ faster!**

**Real examples by modulation**:

**BPSK (Binary PSK)**: - 1 symbol = 1 bit - 2 possible positions
(up or down) - Like: Light switch (on/off)

**QPSK**: - 1 symbol = 2 bits - 4 possible positions - Like: 4-way
hand gesture

**16-QAM**: - 1 symbol = 4 bits - 16 possible positions - Like:
Showing fingers (0-15)

**256-QAM**: - 1 symbol = 8 bits - 256 possible positions! - Like:
Sign language with 256 distinct signs

**Why symbols matter**:

**Symbol rate vs bit rate**: - **Symbol rate**: How many
symbols per second? - **Bit rate**: How many bits per second? -
**Relationship**: Bit rate = Symbol rate \$\times\$
bits/symbol

**Example - WiFi**: - Symbol rate: 250,000 symbols/second -
Modulation: 256-QAM (8 bits/symbol) - Bit rate: 250,000
\$\times\$ 8 = 2 Mbps

**Bandwidth connection**: - Symbols take time/frequency (bandwidth)
- More symbols/second = more bandwidth needed - But: More bits/symbol =
free speed boost!

**The constellation diagram**: - Visual map of all possible symbols
- Each dot = one unique symbol - More dots = more bits/symbol = faster!

**Real-world impact**: - Your phone: Switches between modulations
(QPSK \$\rightarrow\$ 64-QAM) = switching symbol mappings
- Strong signal: Use symbols with 8 bits each (fast!) - Weak signal: Use
symbols with 2 bits each (reliable!)

**Fun fact**: When your WiFi says “MCS 9, 256-QAM”, that means
each symbol carries 8 bits. If you move away and it drops to “MCS 0,
BPSK”, each symbol now carries only 1 bit---that's
an 8\$\times\$ speed difference, just by changing how many
bits each symbol represents!

In digital communication, a **symbol** is a fundamental unit of
information transmitted over the channel. Think of symbols as the
“words” of a digital communication system.

## The Symbol Hierarchy

    Raw Data (Bits)
        
    Grouped into Symbols
        
    Mapped to Signal States
        
    Transmitted over Channel

## Example: From Bits to Symbols

Imagine you want to transmit the binary data:
`0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0`

Instead of sending each bit individually, we group them into pairs (for
QPSK): - Bits `0 0` \$\rightarrow\$ Symbol 1 -
Bits `1 1` \$\rightarrow\$ Symbol 2  
- Bits `0 1` \$\rightarrow\$ Symbol 3 - Bits
`1 0` \$\rightarrow\$ Symbol 4

This grouping allows us to transmit more efficiently and makes the
signal more robust to noise.

## Why Use Symbols?

1.  **Efficiency**: Transmitting symbols (groups of bits) can be more
    bandwidth-efficient than transmitting individual bits

2.  **Robustness**: Symbol-based schemes can be designed to be more
    resistant to noise and interference

3.  **Flexibility**: Different modulation schemes can encode
    different numbers of bits per symbol

## Bits Per Symbol in Common Modulation Schemes

| Modulation | Bits/Symbol | Total States |
|:-----------|:------------|:-------------|
| BPSK       | 1           | 2            |
| **QPSK**   | **2**       | **4**        |
| 8PSK       | 3           | 8            |
| 16QAM      | 4           | 16           |
| 64QAM      | 6           | 64           |

**Chimera uses QPSK** (2 bits per symbol, 4 states)
