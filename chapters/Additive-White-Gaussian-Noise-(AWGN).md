# Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)

##  For Non-Technical Readers

**AWGN is the “static” or “hiss” you hear on old
radios---random interference that corrupts signals.**

**Real-world analogies**: - **Old TV static**: Random noise
when you lose the signal - **Grainy photos in low light**: Camera
sensors produce AWGN when there's not enough light -
**Bluetooth stuttering**: Weak signals get corrupted by AWGN

**Where it comes from**: Thermal noise (electrons jiggling from
heat), electronic components, even faint cosmic microwave background
radiation.

**Why it matters**: AWGN is the **fundamental limit** on
communication. You can't eliminate it, but you can
overcome it with more power, error correction, or better antennas.

**AWGN** is a basic noise model used in communication systems.

## What is AWGN?

- **Additive**: Noise is added to the signal

- **White**: Uniform power across all frequencies

- **Gaussian**: Follows a normal (Gaussian) probability
  distribution

## Visualizing AWGN

## AWGN Channel Model

In the I/Q plane, AWGN adds independent Gaussian noise to both
components:

    Received Symbol = Transmitted Symbol + Noise

    I_received = I_transmitted + N_I
    Q_received = Q_transmitted + N_Q

    where N_I and N_Q are independent Gaussian random variables

## Mathematical Properties

The noise samples have: - **Mean**: 0 (centered around zero) -
**Variance**:
\$\sigma\$\textsuperscript{2} (determined
by noise power) - **Probability Distribution**: Gaussian (bell
curve)

    Probability Density:

      +----------------- Amplitude
           0

## Why AWGN is Used

1.  **Simplicity**: Mathematical tractability for analysis

2.  **Fundamental Model**: Many real noise sources approximate
    Gaussian statistics

3.  **Worst Case**: Often represents a pessimistic but realistic
    scenario

4.  **Standard Benchmark**: Industry-standard for comparing systems

## Sources of Noise in Real Systems

- **Thermal Noise**: Random motion of electrons (kTB)

- **Amplifier Noise**: Electronic component noise

- **Cosmic Noise**: Background radiation

- **Interference**: Other signals (approximates Gaussian when many
  sources)

## AWGN in Chimera

Chimera's simulation applies AWGN to model the
communication channel: - Noise is added separately to I and Q components
- Noise power is controlled by the
\[\[Signal-to-Noise-Ratio-(SNR)\]\] setting - Higher SNR = less
noise variance = tighter constellation clusters

### Noise Power Calculation

    Noise Variance (²) = Signal Power / SNR_linear
                        = Signal Power / 10^(SNR_dB/10)

For unit signal power and SNR = 10 dB:

    ² = 1 / 10^(10/10) = 1/10 = 0.1
     = 0.1  0.316

## Impact on Constellation

    High Noise ( = 0.5):          Low Noise ( = 0.1):
      
      Q                               Q
                                     
      |                            |  
      |                          | 
      |                            |  
    --+---- I                    ----+-- I

    Large scatter = high errors    Tight cluster = low errors
