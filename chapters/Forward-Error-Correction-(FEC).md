# Forward Error Correction (FEC)

##  For Non-Technical Readers

**FEC is like sending instructions with built-in spell-checker
clues---even if some words get garbled, you can figure out what was
meant!**

**The problem**: - Radio channels add noise/interference - Bits get
flipped: 1\$\rightarrow\$0 or
0\$\rightarrow\$1 - By the time you notice,
it's too late to ask “can you repeat that?”

**The FEC solution - Add smart redundancy**:

**Simple example - Repetition**: - Want to send: `1` - FEC
adds redundancy: `1 1 1` (send it 3 times) - Received:
`1 0 1` (middle bit corrupted!) - Decoder: “Two 1s, one 0?
Probably was `1`!”

**Real codes are smarter**: - **Hamming code**: 4 data bits +
3 parity bits = fix any single error - **Reed-Solomon**: Used in
CDs, DVDs, QR codes---can fix burst errors! - **Turbo/LDPC
codes**: Used in 4G/5G---nearly as good as theoretical limit!

**Real-world examples**: - **QR codes**: Can work with 30%
missing---that's FEC! - **Satellite TV**:
Signal is weak, so FEC fixes errors without re-sending - **Deep
space probes**: Can't retransmit from Mars! FEC is
critical - **Your WiFi**: Uses LDPC codes to fix interference from
microwave ovens

**Trade-off**: - More redundancy = fix more errors BUT slower
transmission - Your phone adjusts: strong signal = less FEC (fast), weak
signal = more FEC (reliable)

**Fun fact**: The Voyager probes launched in 1977 still communicate
with Earth (15+ billion miles away!) using FEC codes to fix the
incredibly noisy signal.

**Forward Error Correction (FEC)** adds redundancy to transmitted
data so the receiver can detect and correct errors without
retransmission.

## How FEC Works

    Original Data:     [100 bits]
          
    FEC Encoder:       [Add redundancy]
          
    Encoded Data:      [150 bits with parity]
          
    Noisy Channel:     [Errors introduced]
          
    FEC Decoder:       [Correct errors using redundancy]
          
    Recovered Data:    [100 bits, hopefully error-free]

## Key Concept

FEC trades **bandwidth efficiency** for **reliability**: -
**More redundancy** = better error correction but lower data rate -
**Less redundancy** = higher data rate but less error protection

## Code Rate

The **code rate** is the ratio of information bits to total bits:

    Code Rate = Information Bits / Total Bits

    Example: 
    - 100 information bits
    - 50 parity bits
    - Total: 150 bits
    - Code Rate: 100/150 = 2/3

Common code rates: - **1/2**: Very robust, 50% overhead -
**2/3**: Good balance - **3/4**: Efficient, less redundancy -
**5/6**: High efficiency, minimal redundancy

## Types of FEC Codes

### Block Codes

- Process fixed-size blocks of data

- Examples: Hamming, Reed-Solomon, BCH, **LDPC**

### Convolutional Codes

- Process continuous stream of data

- Examples: Viterbi, Turbo codes

### Modern Codes

- **LDPC**: Low-Density Parity-Check (used in Chimera!)

- **Turbo**: Parallel concatenated codes

- **Polar**: Capacity-achieving codes

## FEC Gain (Coding Gain)

**Coding Gain** measures the SNR improvement provided by FEC:

    Without FEC: Need SNR = 10 dB for BER = 10
    With FEC:    Need SNR = 2 dB for BER = 10

    Coding Gain = 10 dB - 2 dB = 8 dB

This means FEC saves 8 dB of transmit power!

## FEC Performance Metrics

### 1. Coding Gain

How much SNR improvement at a given BER

### 2. Error Floor

Minimum BER achievable (implementation limits)

### 3. Waterfall Region

SNR range where BER drops rapidly

### 4. Threshold

SNR where FEC “turns on” effectively

    BER Curve with FEC:

    BER
     
    10 |
        |  
    10³ |             Waterfall
        |               Region
    10 |        ___   Threshold
        |            +
    10 |             +___  Error Floor
        +------------------- SNR (dB)
         Threshold

## FEC in Chimera

In Chimera's simulation:

### 1. Encoder

- Applies \[\[LDPC-CodesLDPC\]\] encoding to payload data

- Adds parity symbols for error correction

### 2. Channel

- \[\[Additive-White-Gaussian-Noise-(AWGN)AWGN\]\] corrupts
  the transmitted symbols

### 3. Decoder

- Iterative LDPC decoder corrects errors

- Uses belief propagation algorithm

### 4. Metrics

- **ECC symbols**: Number of parity/redundancy symbols added

- **Pre-FEC errors**: Errors at the demodulator output  

- **Post-FEC errors**: Residual errors after LDPC correction

- **Frame Error Rate**: Percentage of frames that
  couldn't be fully corrected

## Example Performance

    Channel Conditions:
    - SNR: -15 dB
    - BER without FEC: 10² (1%)

    After LDPC FEC:
    - Code rate: 1/2
    - Iterations: 50
    - Post-FEC BER: 10 (0.0001%)

    Result: 40 dB coding gain! 

## Why FEC is Essential

### Deep Space Communications

- Very weak signals (high link loss)

- Retransmission impractical (minutes of delay)

- FEC allows operation at lower SNR

### Satellite Links

- Power-limited transmitters

- FEC saves precious transmit power

- Standard in DVB-S2, GPS

### Mobile Communications

- Fading channels, interference

- FEC provides robustness

- Used in LTE, 5G, WiFi

### Data Storage

- Bits can flip over time

- FEC protects against corruption

- Used in SSDs, hard drives, QR codes

## Shannon Limit

**Claude Shannon** proved there's a theoretical
limit to how much FEC can help:

    Shannon Capacity:
    C = B · log(1 + SNR)

    where:
    - C is channel capacity (bits/second)
    - B is bandwidth (Hz)
    - SNR is signal-to-noise ratio (linear)

**Modern codes like LDPC approach this limit!**

## Trade-offs

### Advantages

- Corrects errors without retransmission

- Improves reliability at low SNR

- Saves transmit power

- Enables communication over poor channels

### Disadvantages

- Adds latency (encoding/decoding delay)

- Requires computational resources

- Reduces effective data rate (overhead)

- More complex implementation
