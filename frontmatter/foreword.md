<div class="center">

There will come a time in your life when you will ask yourself a series of questions.

*Am I happy with who I am?*  
*Am I happy with the people around me?*  
*Am I happy with what I’m doing?*  
*Am I happy with the way my life is going?*  
*Do I have a life or am I just living?*

**Do not let these questions strain or trouble you—just point yourself in the direction of your dreams, find your strength in the sound, and *make your transition***.

Do not spend too much time thinking and not enough doing.

*Did I try the hardest at any of my dreams?*  
*Did I purposely let others discourage me when I knew I could?*  
*Will I die never knowing what I could have been or could have done?*

**Do not let these doubts restrain or trouble you—just point yourself in the direction of your dreams. Find your strength in the sound and *make your transition***.

There will be people who say you can’t—**you will.**  
There will be people who say you don’t mix this with that,  
and you will say “**watch me**.”  
There will be people who will say play it safe, that’s too risky—  
**you will take that chance and have no fear.**  
**You won’t let these questions restrain or trouble you.**  
**You will point yourself in the direction of your dreams.**  
**You will find the strength in the sound and *make your transition*.**

For those who know it’s time to leave the house and go back to the field:  
**Find your strength in the sound and *make your transition*.**
