*To Alan Turing, the 27 Unnamed Women and countless others who have suffered untold horrors at the hands of the ghastly project burdened with the same name.*

*May the words in this book bring some peace to a troubled world.*

*May you be happy, May you be safe, May you be well.*

To those I have hurt in the process, I am sorry.

*To Saba, my parents and everyone who has suffered with me throughout this ordeal, for everything.*

For everything we have done, and are yet do, come what may.\*

***Be Not Afraid.***
