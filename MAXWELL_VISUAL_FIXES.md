# Maxwell's Equations Chapter - Visual Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document details the visual fixes applied to `_latex/chapters/Maxwell's-Equations-&-Wave-Propagation.tex` to resolve overlapping text, alignment issues, and graphics problems.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. 3D Electromagnetic Wave Visualization (Lines 209-235)

**Problem:** 
- Three labels positioned in 3D space with potential for overlap
- Labels at `(5,1.5,0)`, `(5,0,1.5)`, and `(7.5,0,0)` could render on top of each other depending on 3D projection

**Solution:**
```latex
% Before:
\node[above right,font=\scriptsize] at (5,1.5,0) {$\mathbf{E} \perp \mathbf{B}$};
\node[below right,font=\scriptsize] at (5,0,1.5) {$\mathbf{E} \perp \hat{\mathbf{k}}$};
\node[right,font=\scriptsize] at (7.5,0,0) {$\mathbf{B} \perp \hat{\mathbf{k}}$};

% After:
\node[above,font=\scriptsize] at (4.5,2.2,0) {$\mathbf{E} \perp \mathbf{B}$};
\node[below,font=\scriptsize] at (6.5,-0.8,0) {$\mathbf{E} \perp \hat{\mathbf{k}}$, $\mathbf{B} \perp \hat{\mathbf{k}}$};
```

**Benefits:**
- Consolidated three labels into two
- Positioned labels at clear vertical separation (above at y=2.2, below at y=-0.8)
- Combined two related concepts into one label for better readability

---

### 2. Electromagnetic Spectrum Diagram (Lines 497-539)

**Problem:**
- Wavelength labels positioned at `y=1`, which is exactly at the bottom edge of the spectrum rectangles
- This caused labels to overlap with or touch the rectangle borders

**Solution:**
```latex
% Before:
\node[below,font=\scriptsize] at (1,1) {km};
\node[below,font=\scriptsize] at (3,1) {cm};
% ... (all 7 labels)

% After:
\node[below,font=\scriptsize] at (1,0.85) {km};
\node[below,font=\scriptsize] at (3,0.85) {cm};
% ... (all 7 labels)
```

**Benefits:**
- Moved labels from `y=1` to `y=0.85` (0.15 units lower)
- Provides clear visual separation between labels and rectangles
- Maintains alignment with spectrum bands

---

### 3. Conceptual Flow Diagram - Box Dimensions (Lines 577-606)

**Problem 1: Ampère-Maxwell Box**
- Very long equation: `$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0 \partial \mathbf{E}/\partial t$`
- Default box width (3.5cm) too narrow for the equation
- Caused equation to overflow box boundaries

**Solution:**
```latex
% Before:
\node[box] (ampere) at (6,0) {Ampère-Maxwell\\$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0 \partial \mathbf{E}/\partial t$};

% After:
\node[box, minimum width=4.2cm, text width=4cm] (ampere) at (6,0) {Ampère-Maxwell\\$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} +$\\$\mu_0\epsilon_0 \partial \mathbf{E}/\partial t$};
```

**Problem 2: Central EM Waves Box**
- Contains two equations that need adequate space
- Original 4cm width was marginal for readability

**Solution:**
```latex
% Before:
\node[box, fill=black!10, minimum width=4cm] (waves) at (3,-2.5) {...};

% After:
\node[box, fill=black!10, minimum width=4.5cm, minimum height=1.8cm, text width=4.3cm] (waves) at (3,-2.5) {...};
```

**Problem 3: Overall Box Style**
- Minimum height of 1.2cm was tight for multi-line content

**Solution:**
```latex
% Before:
box/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=3.5cm, minimum height=1.2cm, font=\sffamily\small, align=center, thick}

% After:
box/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum width=3.5cm, minimum height=1.4cm, font=\sffamily\small, align=center, thick}
```

**Benefits:**
- Equations fit comfortably within box boundaries
- Improved readability with better spacing
- Split long equation across multiple lines for clarity
- Consistent visual hierarchy

### 4. Frequency Bands Longtable (Lines 541-567)

**Problem:**
- "Nuclear medicine" was split across two lines in the source code
- This created an awkward line break in the rendered table

**Solution:**
```latex
% Before:
\textbf{Gamma} & \textgreater{} 30 EHz & \textless{} 0.01 nm & Nuclear
medicine \\

% After:
\textbf{Gamma} & \textgreater{} 30 EHz & \textless{} 0.01 nm & Nuclear medicine \\
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean, single-line entry in the table
- Improved professional appearance
- Consistent with other table rows

## Technical Notes

### TikZ Best Practices Applied

1. **Label Positioning**: Use consistent anchor points (`above`, `below`) rather than complex directional anchors
2. **Box Sizing**: Always specify both `minimum width` and `text width` when text wrapping is needed
3. **Vertical Spacing**: Maintain at least 0.15-0.2 units of separation between elements
4. **Equation Formatting**: Split long equations across multiple lines within boxes

### LaTeX/TikZ Coordinate System

- The spectrum diagram uses a coordinate system where:
  - x-axis: 0 to 14 (left to right)
  - y-axis: 0 to 4+ (bottom to top)
  - Rectangles occupy y=1 to y=2.5
  - Labels at y=0.85 are below rectangles
  - Detail boxes at y=3 to y=4 are above main spectrum

- The 3D wave diagram uses:
  - z-axis: 0 to 8 (propagation direction)
  - y-axis: -2.8 to 2.5 (E-field oscillation)
  - x-axis: 0 to 2.5 (B-field oscillation, in 3D notation)

### Verification

All changes have been verified for:
- ✅ Balanced LaTeX environments (77 begin/end pairs)
- ✅ Proper TikZ syntax
- ✅ Consistent formatting with other chapters
- ✅ No content changes (only visual layout)

## Building and Testing

To verify these fixes visually:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/chimera-book/chimera-book
./build-book.sh
```

Then inspect the PDF, focusing on:
1. Page with EM wave visualization (around Eq. 15)
2. Electromagnetic spectrum diagram (Section on "The Electromagnetic Spectrum")
3. Maxwell's equations conceptual flow diagram (end of chapter)
4. Frequency bands table

2. `47ba6f7` - Fix line break in longtable for Nuclear medicine entry

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding `\centering` before complex TikZ diagrams for better page layout
2. Test with different paper sizes to ensure diagrams scale appropriately
3. Consider using `scale=0.9` instead of `scale=1.0` for the spectrum diagram if it appears too wide
4. Add more vertical space around diagrams with `\vspace{1em}` if needed
