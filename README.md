This repository contains the complete, press-ready source code for the book **Digital Signal Processing: The Chimera Project**.

Beyond the content itself, this project is designed to serve as an advanced, comprehensive exemplar for creating professional, narrative-driven books using a modern LaTeX toolchain. It addresses a common gap in the community by providing a complete, working example of a book that is ready for a professional print-on-demand service, from the cover art to the final PDF/X-1a compliant interior.

## ðŸ“š The Philosophy

The decision to release the entire projectâ€”the book's content, the typesetting engine, and the build scriptsâ€”into the public domain via **CC0** is a deliberate act aligned with the book's core themes. It is a challenge to closed systems and an effort to provide open, unencumbered tools for others to build upon and share their own knowledge freely.

This repository is the very resource I was looking for when I began: a complete, high-quality example to learn from. My hope is that it will serve that purpose for others.

## ðŸš€ Features

This template is built with professional production in mind and includes a host of advanced features out of the box:

*   **Professional Typography:** A classic pairing of Minion Pro for body text and Myriad Pro for headings, with the perfectly matched Minion Math font for all equations.
*   **Modern LaTeX Toolchain:** Built on `XeLaTeX` for native OpenType font support, `biblatex` and `biber` for bibliography management, and `unicode-math` for modern math typesetting.
*   **Press-Ready Output:** Generates a **PDF/X-1a:2003 compliant** file, the industry standard for "blind exchange" with printers.
*   **Professional Color Management:** Configured for the **FOGRA39** color profile, the standard for Australian and European printing.
*   **Dynamic Output Modes:** A single switch in the preamble toggles the entire book between a full-color digital version and a cost-effective, optimized grayscale version for print.
*   **Sophisticated Design System:**
    *   A complete, narrative-driven front matter including a dedication, prelude, multi-part foreword, and introduction.
    *   Custom-designed callout boxes (`tcolorbox`) for notes, key concepts, and warnings.
    *   Elegant chapter and section styling using `titlesec`.
*   **Reproducible Build Process:** A simple shell script (`build-book.sh`) automates the entire compilation process, including all necessary LaTeX and Biber passes.
*   **Advanced Tooling:** Includes `minted` for high-quality syntax highlighting and `cleveref` for intelligent cross-referencing.

## ðŸ”§ How to Build

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

1.  **A Full TeX Live Installation (2025 or later):** A minimal installation will likely fail. This project relies on `xelatex`, `biber`, and a number of standard packages.
2.  **Python and Pygments:** The `minted` package requires Pygments for syntax highlighting.
    ```bash
    pip install Pygments
    ```
3.  **Required Fonts:**
    *   **Minion Pro & Myriad Pro:** These are commercial Adobe fonts and must be installed on your system.
    *   **Minion Math:** This can be installed using the `getnonfreefonts` script provided by TeX Live. See the [TeX Live documentation](https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/) for instructions. (Typically `sudo getnonfreefonts-sys -a`).
    *   **Latin Modern:** The standard `lmodern` package should be installed via `tlmgr`.

### Build Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Ensure Prerequisites are Met:** Verify that all required fonts and software are installed on your system. The build will fail if fonts are missing.
3.  **Run the Build Script:** The script handles all the complexities of the LaTeX build process.
    ```bash
    ./build-book.sh
    ```
4.  **Find the Output:** The final, press-ready PDF will be located in the `_build` directory.

### Customizing the Output (Color vs. Grayscale)

To switch between the full-color digital version and the grayscale print version, open the `latex/preamble.tex` file and change the following line at the top:

*   For **full color**: `\printversionfalse`
*   For **grayscale**: `\printversiontrue`

Then, simply re-run the build script.
