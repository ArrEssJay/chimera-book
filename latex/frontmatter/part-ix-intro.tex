A treatise is not only a source of knowledge but a tool for the practitioner. The tradition of appending reference material to a major scientific work is a recognition that theory is ultimately in service of application. From the comprehensive star catalogues of early astronomers to the integral tables of 19th-century mathematicians, such references provide the essential scaffolding for future work.

This final section of the book is dedicated to providing that scaffolding. It contains the essential tools for the practising engineer and the curious researcher. The Formula Reference Card consolidates the key equations for rapid calculation. The Glossary provides a quick-reference to the entire lexicon of the field. Finally, the Curated Bibliography and Resources serves not as a simple list of citations, but as a map to the foundational literature and a guide for the reader's own continued journey into the world of digital signal processing.
