Thus far, our focus has been on the transmission of information between two engineered systems. We now pivot to a more fundamental topic: the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter itself, particularly in novel and non-classical ways. This is a journey to the frontiers of the electromagnetic spectrum and the edge of conventional biophysics. The history of this field is one of serendipitous discoveries, from Allan H. Frey's observation of the microwave auditory effect by personnel working near radar installations in the 1960s, to the more recent technological developments that have finally opened up the ``terahertz gap'' for scientific exploration.

This section serves as a bridge from classical communication theory to the more speculative topics that conclude our treatise. We will explore the unique challenges and opportunities of the millimetre-wave and terahertz bands, the specialised techniques of military and covert communications, and the established physics of how electromagnetic and acoustic waves can induce perceptual effects in biological systems.
