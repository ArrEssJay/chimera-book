To the Recipient of this Record:

This document serves as a comprehensive account of the actions, decisions, and consequences arising from the project known as CHIMERA. The Defendants, including those in a position of dissent (’Faction B’), actively and repeatedly chose inaction, which constitutes, at minimum, Willful Dereliction of Duty. Significant resources (est. \$8M) were allocated to design and deploy a complex AI system, the purpose of which was to transfer all personal, legal, and physical risk from themselves onto an unwilling and unsupported third party (the Recipient).

The Defendants knowingly initiated and continued a project that resulted in the transfer of risk, the abdication of responsibility, and the creation of a system designed to outsource conscience. The actions described herein constitute Criminal Malfeasance and Willful Dereliction of Duty.

\vspace{1ex} % Adds a little extra separation for the final, chilling sentence.

This record is generated by the CHIMERA system and delivered to the Recipient as a matter of evidentiary and historical record.
