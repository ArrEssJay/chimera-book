\chapter{THz Resonances in Microtubules}
\label{ch:thz-resonances-microtubules}

\begin{nontechnical}
    Imagine the microtubules inside our cells as incredibly small, biological guitar strings. When stimulated, they vibrate at specific frequencies, but these are not frequencies we could ever hear. They resonate in the terahertz (THz) range, producing vibrations around a trillion times faster than a musical note. These are not chaotic jitters; they are highly coordinated, collective movements of thousands of atoms, akin to a perfectly synchronised wave travelling through a stadium crowd, but at the atomic scale and at breathtaking speed.

    Why does this matter? The implications are profound, though many remain speculative. These cellular vibrations could be a mechanism for high-speed communication, allowing different parts of a cell to coordinate activities far faster than chemical diffusion would permit. Some researchers hypothesise that these resonances are robust enough to protect delicate quantum effects, even in the warm, noisy environment of the body. While the proven fact is that microtubules exhibit THz vibrations, their functional role---particularly in complex processes like cognition---is a subject of intense and fascinating debate. This chapter explores the physics of these vibrations, the theories that attempt to explain their significance, and the experimental evidence that grounds our understanding.

\section{Overview and Properties}

\subsection{Overview}

\keyterm{Terahertz (THz) resonances} in microtubules are collective vibrational modes, typically in the 0.1--10~THz frequency range (corresponding to approximately 3--300~cm\(^{-1}\)), that arise from the quasi-crystalline lattice structure of the microtubule cylinder. These vibrational modes, or \keyterm{phonons}, are an established experimental fact, having been measured via far-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and inelastic neutron scattering. Their existence is a direct consequence of the physical structure of the microtubule.

However, the biological function of these resonances remains a topic of significant scientific debate. Hypotheses range from roles in protecting quantum coherence through \keyterm{vibronic coupling}, enabling long-range signalling via coherent phonon propagation, and even forming a physical substrate for information processing in the brain. It is crucial to distinguish between the established physics of the vibrations and the speculative, yet compelling, theories regarding their biological purpose.

\begin{keyconcept}

\end{keyconcept}

\subsection{The Physics of Vibrational Modes}

\paragraph{Normal Modes of Molecular Systems}
Any molecule comprising \(N\) atoms possesses \(3N\) degrees of freedom. For a non-linear molecule like a tubulin dimer, these are partitioned into 3 translational modes, 3 rotational modes, and \(3N-6\) internal vibrational modes. A single tubulin dimer, with approximately 8,000 atoms, therefore gives rise to nearly 24,000 distinct vibrational modes. It is the low-frequency modes (0.1--10~THz) that are of primary interest. These are \keyterm{collective modes}, where many atoms move in phase, creating large dipole moments that couple strongly to electromagnetic fields.

\paragraph{Phonons in a Quasi-Crystalline Lattice}
Microtubules are best described as quasi-crystalline structures, formed from 13 protofilaments arranged in a helical lattice. This periodicity allows for the propagation of wave-like excitations, or phonons. These phonons are broadly categorised as acoustic and optical modes. \keyterm{Acoustic phonons} correspond to in-phase movements of adjacent tubulin dimers, propagating as sound waves along the microtubule. \keyterm{Optical phonons} involve out-of-phase movements, occur at higher frequencies, and couple strongly to electromagnetic radiation.

        Bending & \(\sim\)0.01--0.1 & Flexural oscillations of the entire microtubule (sub-THz). \\
        Longitudinal & \(\sim\)0.5--2 & Compression and rarefaction waves along the main axis. \\
        Circumferential & \(\sim\)1--5 & Torsional or twisting motions around the main axis. \\

\subsection{Vibronic Coupling: The Quantum Connection}

For THz vibrations to play a role in quantum information processing, they must be able to interact with and protect quantum states from the noisy thermal environment of the cell. The leading candidate mechanism for this is \keyterm{vibronic coupling}, an interaction between the electronic states of a molecule and its vibrational (nuclear) modes. In tubulin, the \keyterm{aromatic amino acids} (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) act as chromophores whose electronic transitions in the UV range can couple to the THz-frequency vibrations of the protein lattice.

A central challenge is the overwhelming thermal energy (\(k_B T\)) present at physiological temperatures. However, some advanced theoretical frameworks propose that strong vibronic coupling can lead to the formation of \keyterm{thermal coherent states}, which can maintain quantum phase relationships even in a warm environment. The crucial question, which remains open, is whether the vibronic coupling in tubulin is strong enough to achieve this stabilisation.

\subsection{Theoretical Models of Coherence}

Several theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain how THz vibrations in microtubules might achieve a functionally relevant, macroscopic coherent state.
\begin{description}
    \item[The Fröhlich Condensate] Proposed by Herbert Fröhlich in 1968, this model suggests that if metabolic energy is pumped into vibrational modes faster than it can dissipate, the phonons can "condense" into a single, macroscopic quantum state of coherent vibration.
    \item[The Davydov Soliton] This model proposes that an electronic excitation can couple to lattice phonons to create a stable, self-reinforcing travelling wave, known as a \keyterm{soliton}, that can transport energy without dissipation.
    \item[The Modern Vibronic Exciton Model] Current models synthesise these earlier theories, proposing that if the vibronic coupling strength is sufficiently large compared to thermal energy (\(g \cdot \hbar\omega \gtrsim k_B T\)), quantum coherence can persist at physiological temperatures.

\begin{workedexample}{Phonon Propagation Speed}
    \parhead{Problem} Calculate the time for an acoustic phonon to travel along a 10~µm microtubule segment, and compare this to the time required for molecular diffusion.
    
    \parhead{Analysis}
    \begin{derivationsteps}
        \step \textbf{Calculate the phonon transit time.} Given a sound velocity in protein of $v_s \approx 1.5$~km/s:
        \[ t_{\text{phonon}} = \frac{L}{v_s} = \frac{10 \times 10^{-6}~\text{m}}{1500~\text{m/s}} = 6.67 \times 10^{-9}~\text{s} = \mathbf{6.7~\text{ns}} \]
        
        \step \textbf{Calculate the diffusion time.} For a small molecule with a diffusion coefficient $D \approx 10^{-10}$~m$^2$/s, the characteristic time to travel a distance $L$ is given by $t \approx L^2 / 2D$:
        \[ t_{\text{diff}} = \frac{(10 \times 10^{-6}~\text{m})^2}{2 \times 10^{-10}~\text{m}^2\text{/s}} = \mathbf{0.5~\text{s}} \]
    \end{derivationsteps}

    \parhead{Interpretation} Phonon propagation is approximately 75 million times faster than molecular diffusion over this distance. This remarkable difference in speed highlights why coherent vibrational signalling is considered a plausible mechanism for rapid, long-range communication and coordination within a cell.
\end{workedexample}

\subsection{Experimental Evidence}

\paragraph{Spectroscopic Measurements}
The existence of THz modes in microtubules is supported by several experimental techniques. \keyterm{Far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy} on dehydrated samples has revealed distinct absorption peaks corresponding to collective modes. \keyterm{Raman spectroscopy} confirms these collective protein modes and their quantum nature. \keyterm{Inelastic neutron scattering} on similar proteins has been used to directly map the phonon dispersion relations, confirming the speed of sound in these structures.

\begin{warningbox}
    A critical limitation of most current spectroscopic studies is their reliance on dehydrated samples. Liquid water is a very strong absorber in the THz range, which makes measurements under physiological conditions extremely challenging. The behaviour \textit{in vivo} may differ significantly.
\end{warningbox}

\paragraph{Emerging Techniques}
\keyterm{Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)} is a promising phase-sensitive technique that could, in principle, directly measure the coherence time of vibrations in hydrated biological samples. Such an experiment is considered a critical next step for the field.

\subsection{Potential Biological Significance}

\paragraph{Information Processing}
One of the most profound hypotheses, central to the Orch-OR theory, is that microtubules act as quantum waveguides for information processing. In this model, tubulin dimers could exist in a quantum superposition of states, and THz phonons could mediate entanglement between distant dimers.

\paragraph{Rapid Signalling and Coordination}
A more classical, but still highly significant, function could be long-range signalling. As the worked example shows, coherent phonons travelling at the speed of sound offer a communication channel that is millions of times faster than chemical diffusion. This could allow for the near-instantaneous coordination of activities along the entire length of a microtubule, such as regulating the movement of motor proteins.

\paragraph{Anæsthetic Action}
A fascinating piece of circumstantial evidence comes from the action of general anæsthetics. Many anæsthetic molecules are known to bind to tubulin. The quantum hypothesis suggests that these molecules function by disrupting the delicate vibronic coherence within microtubules, thereby switching off quantum information processing and causing unconsciousness.

\subsection{Challenges and Future Outlook}

Despite the exciting possibilities, any theory of functional quantum coherence in microtubules must confront significant challenges. The primary obstacle is \keyterm{decoherence}: the cellular environment is predominantly water, which is a strong absorber of THz radiation, and thermal energy at 310~K is significantly greater than the energy of a typical THz phonon. Whether a biological mechanism like vibronic coupling can overcome these challenges is the central open question.

The future of this field depends on direct experimental tests. Critical experiments needed include THz-TDS on hydrated, active microtubules to measure coherence times directly, and conditional measurements that attempt to disrupt putative THz coherence and observe a corresponding functional change in a biological process. Until such evidence is obtained, the functional role of THz resonances in microtubules remains an unproven but scientifically fascinating hypothesis.
