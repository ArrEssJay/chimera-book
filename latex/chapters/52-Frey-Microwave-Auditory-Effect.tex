\chapter{The Microwave Auditory Effect}
\label{ch:frey-effect}

\begin{nontechnical}
    \textbf{The microwave auditory effect, or Frey effect, is the phenomenon of hearing sound when your head is exposed to certain types of pulsed microwave radiation.} It is not science fiction; it is a well-documented biophysical effect.

    \parhead{How it works: A tiny, fast pressure wave}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A rapid pulse of microwave energy (similar to that from a radar system, but not a mobile phone) is absorbed by the soft tissues inside your head.
        \item This causes a minuscule, but extremely rapid, temperature increase (about one-millionth of a degree Celsius).
        \item This rapid heating causes the tissue to expand infinitesimally, creating a tiny thermoelastic pressure wave.
        \item This pressure wave travels through your head to your inner ear (the cochlea).
        \item The hair cells in your cochlea detect this pressure wave exactly as they would detect a normal sound wave, and your brain perceives a "click" or a "buzz".
    \end{enumerate}

    \parhead{Key characteristics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The "sound" is generated \textbf{inside your head}, not in the air. Someone standing next to you will hear nothing.
        \item It requires \textbf{pulsed} energy. A continuous-wave signal, like from a WiFi router, does not produce the effect.
        \item The perceived pitch of the sound corresponds to the \textbf{pulse repetition rate}, not the microwave carrier frequency.
        \item It is generally considered safe at the power levels required to induce the perception.
    \end{itemize}

    \parhead{Real-world context}
    The effect was first documented in the 1960s by personnel working near radar installations. It has been studied extensively, primarily by the military, as a potential basis for non-lethal weapons or specialised communication systems.
\end{nontechnical}


\subsection{Overview}

The \keyterm{microwave auditory effect}, first systematically documented by Allan H. Frey in 1961, is the human perception of sound when exposed to pulsed or modulated microwave radiation. The phenomenon is not an auditory hallucination; it is a physical process where electromagnetic energy is converted into acoustic energy inside the head.

\begin{keyconcept}
    The mechanism for the Frey effect is \textbf{thermoelastic transduction}. Each microwave pulse causes a minute, rapid thermal expansion of the soft tissues in the head. This expansion launches a pressure wave that propagates to the inner ear and is detected by the cochlea via bone conduction. The perceived sound corresponds to the pulse repetition frequency of the microwave source.
\end{keyconcept}


\subsection{Physical Mechanism}

The process involves a direct energy conversion chain from electromagnetic to acoustic energy.

\begin{description}
    \item[1. Microwave Absorption] Pulsed microwave energy, typically in the 1-10 GHz range, penetrates the skull and is absorbed by the water-rich brain and auditory tissues.
    \item[2. Rapid Heating] The absorbed energy causes a very small and very fast temperature rise, on the order of $10^{-6}$ K per pulse. This heating must occur faster than the thermal diffusion time of the tissue (typically < 1 ms).
    \item[3. Thermoelastic Expansion] This rapid, localised heating causes the tissue to expand, launching a tiny acoustic pressure wave.
    \item[4. Cochlear Detection] The pressure wave propagates through the skull and tissues to the cochlea of the inner ear, where it is transduced into a neural signal by the same hair cells responsible for normal hearing.
\end{description}

\begin{warningbox}
    The Frey effect requires a \textbf{pulsed} signal. Continuous-wave (CW) signals, such as those from mobile phones or WiFi routers, do not produce the rapid thermal transients necessary to generate a pressure wave and are therefore incapable of causing this effect.
\end{warningbox}


\subsection{Performance Characteristics}

\paragraph{Frequency Dependence}
The effect is most pronounced at frequencies that offer a good balance between penetration into the head and absorption by tissue. The peak sensitivity is found to be around \textbf{2.45 GHz}, which is why many experimental studies use this frequency.

\paragraph{Threshold of Perception}
The effect is triggered by the energy per pulse, not the average power. The threshold for perception is remarkably low, typically in the range of \textbf{1 to 10 $\mu$J/cm$^2$} per pulse. This can result in an average power density that is well below established thermal safety limits.

\paragraph{Perceived Sound}
The character of the perceived sound is determined by the pulse modulation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A single pulse is perceived as a "click" or "pop".
    \item A train of pulses is perceived as a buzz, hum, or tone with a pitch equal to the pulse repetition frequency.
    \item By modulating the pulse repetition rate, it is theoretically possible to transmit complex sounds, including intelligible speech (a concept often dubbed "voice-to-skull").
\end{itemize}


\begin{workedexample}{Radar Installation Safety Analysis}
    \parhead{Problem} An individual is standing 50 metres from a radar antenna, exposed to its sidelobes. Determine if they are likely to experience the microwave auditory effect.
    \parhead{System Parameters}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Radar Frequency: 10 GHz.
        \item Pulse Width ($\tau$): \qty{2}{\mu s}.
        \item Power Density at location ($S$): \qty{50}{mW/cm^2}.
        \item Frey Effect Threshold at 10 GHz: Approx. \qty{30}{\mu J/cm^2} per pulse.
    \end{itemize}
    \parhead{Analysis}
    \begin{derivationsteps}
        \step \textbf{Calculate the energy fluence per pulse.} The energy fluence ($E_f$) is the power density multiplied by the pulse duration.
        \[ E_f = S \times \tau = (50 \times 10^{-3} \text{ W/cm}^2) \times (2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}) = 0.1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ J/cm}^2 = \textbf{\qty{0.1}{\mu J/cm^2}} \]
        \step \textbf{Compare to the perception threshold.}
        \[ \text{Exposure Level} = \qty{0.1}{\mu J/cm^2} \]
        \[ \text{Perception Threshold} = \qty{30}{\mu J/cm^2} \]
    \end{derivationsteps}
    \parhead{Interpretation} The calculated energy fluence per pulse is 300 times \emph{below} the established threshold for perceiving the Frey effect at this frequency. Therefore, the individual would not hear any sound. It is important to note, however, that the average power density might still exceed general public safety limits for RF exposure, even if the auditory effect is not present.

    The Frey effect is a specific and well-defined example of electromagnetic-biological interaction, distinct from other phenomena.
    \begin{description}
        \item[Acoustic Heterodyning] (\Cref{ch:acoustic-heterodyning}) describes a different method for creating directional sound, where the mixing occurs in the air rather than in the head.
        \item[The AID Protocol] (\Cref{ch:aid-protocol}) proposes a purely quantum-mechanical interaction that is explicitly non-thermoelastic and is hypothesised to bypass the cochlea entirely.
        \item[RF Safety] (\Cref{ch:rf-safety}) provides the context for the exposure limits and the distinction between thermal effects and non-thermal effects like the Frey effect.
