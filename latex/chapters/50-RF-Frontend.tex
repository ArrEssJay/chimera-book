\chapter{The RF Front-End: From Antenna to Bits}
\label{ch:rf-front-end}

\begin{nontechnical}
    Imagine you are a signals intelligence officer trying to eavesdrop on a faint, distant whisper. Your equipment is the RF front-end, and every component is critical. First, you need an extremely sensitive parabolic microphone to capture the faint sound waves—this is your \keyterm{antenna}. Immediately connected to it is a special amplifier that can boost the whisper without adding much of its own hiss—this is the \keyterm{Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA)}.

    Next, you must isolate the whisper from the roar of background traffic and other conversations. You use a highly specific audio filter that only allows the precise pitch of the whisper to pass through—this is the \keyterm{bandpass filter}. The signal is still too high-pitched to record directly, so you use a mixer to shift it down to a frequency your recorder can handle—this is \keyterm{downconversion}. Finally, a high-fidelity digital recorder samples this cleaned-up, frequency-shifted signal and converts it into a stream of ones and zeros—this is the \keyterm{Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC)}.

    This entire analogue chain—from the physical wave in the air to the first bits of digital data—is the RF front-end. It is where the pristine mathematics of digital signals collides with the messy, noisy reality of physics. Understanding this hardware is the key to understanding why the sophisticated digital signal processing in the rest of this book is so essential.

\section{Overview and Properties}

\subsection{Overview}

The \keyterm{RF front-end} is the analogue portion of a transceiver that sits between the antenna and the digital backend (the ADC on the receive side and the DAC on the transmit side). It is a cascade of specialised analogue components—amplifiers, filters, mixers, and oscillators—whose collective purpose is to prepare a signal for transmission or to process a received signal for digitisation.

\begin{keyconcept}
    The RF front-end is the bridge between the analogue and digital domains. Its performance fundamentally limits the performance of the entire communication system. No amount of clever digital signal processing can recover information that has been irrevocably lost to noise or distortion in the analogue front-end.
\end{keyconcept}

\subsection{The Receiver (RX) Chain}

The primary goal of the receiver chain is to amplify a very weak, high-frequency signal from the antenna, filter out unwanted interference, and downconvert it to a lower frequency that can be sampled by an Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

\paragraph{The Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA)}
The LNA is the first active component following the antenna and is arguably the most critical component in the entire receiver. As dictated by the Friis formula for cascaded noise, the noise figure of this first stage has a disproportionate impact on the entire system's sensitivity. The LNA's primary function is to provide sufficient gain to overcome the noise of subsequent stages while adding the absolute minimum amount of its own thermal noise.

\paragraph{RF Filtering}
Following the LNA, a \keyterm{bandpass filter} is used to select the desired channel and reject strong out-of-band signals that could otherwise saturate the receiver. In modern mobile devices, these are typically high-performance Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) or Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filters.

\paragraph{Downconversion (Mixing)}
The heart of the receiver is the \keyterm{mixer}, which performs frequency translation. It multiplies the incoming high-frequency RF signal with a pure tone generated by a \keyterm{Local Oscillator (LO)}. This non-linear operation produces sum and difference frequencies:
\begin{equation}
    \cos(2\pi f_{\text{RF}}t) \times \cos(2\pi f_{\text{LO}}t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \cos(2\pi(f_{\text{RF}}-f_{\text{LO}})t) + \cos(2\pi(f_{\text{RF}}+f_{\text{LO}})t) \right]
\end{equation}
A low-pass filter following the mixer removes the high-frequency sum component, leaving only the downconverted \keyterm{Intermediate Frequency (IF)} or baseband signal at \(f_{\text{IF}} = |f_{\text{RF}} - f_{\text{LO}}|\).

\paragraph{The Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC)}
The ADC is the final gateway to the digital domain. It samples the analogue IF or baseband waveform at a high rate and quantises its amplitude into a discrete digital value. The two key parameters of an ADC are its sampling rate (which must satisfy the Nyquist criterion) and its resolution (the number of bits), which determines the dynamic range of the digitised signal.

\subsection{Key Analogue Impairments}

The physical components of the RF front-end are not ideal and introduce a range of impairments that the digital backend must often correct.

\paragraph{Noise Figure (NF)}
As detailed in \Cref{ch:noise}, every active component adds noise. The cumulative NF of the front-end sets the receiver's sensitivity limit.

\paragraph{Non-Linearity}
No real-world amplifier is perfectly linear. At high input power levels, its gain begins to compress, distorting the signal. This is quantified by the \keyterm{1-dB Compression Point (P1dB)}. More importantly, non-linearity causes \keyterm{Intermodulation Distortion (IMD)}, where two strong interfering signals can mix to create new phantom signals that can fall on top of a weak desired channel. This is quantified by the \keyterm{Third-Order Intercept Point (IP3)}.

\paragraph{Phase Noise}
The Local Oscillator is not a perfect tone but has small, random fluctuations in its phase, known as \keyterm{phase noise}. This noise is mixed onto the desired signal during downconversion and appears on a constellation diagram as an angular "smearing" of the symbols, degrading the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM).

\paragraph{I/Q Imbalance}
In a direct-conversion receiver, the I and Q paths of the mixer are never perfectly matched in gain or exactly 90° out of phase. This \keyterm{I/Q imbalance} breaks the perfect orthogonality, causing leakage from the signal into its spectral image and degrading the SNR.

\begin{workedexample}{Cascaded Analysis of a Receiver Front-End}
    \parhead{Problem}
    Calculate the total cascaded noise figure and third-order input intercept point for a simple receiver front-end consisting of an LNA and a mixer.

    \parhead{Component Specifications}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{LNA:} Gain \(G_1 = 20\)~dB, Noise Figure \(NF_1 = 1.5\)~dB, Input IP3 \(IIP3_1 = +10\)~dBm.
        \item \textbf{Mixer:} Conversion Loss \(L_2 = -G_2 = 6\)~dB, Noise Figure \(NF_2 = 6\)~dB, Input IP3 \(IIP3_2 = +25\)~dBm.
    \end{itemize}

    \parhead{Analysis}
    All calculations must be performed using linear values, not decibels.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(G_1 = 10^{20/10} = 100\). \(G_2 = 10^{-6/10} = 0.25\).
        \item \(F_1 = 10^{1.5/10} = 1.41\). \(F_2 = 10^{6/10} = 3.98\).
        \item \(IIP3_1 = 10^{10/10} = 10\)~mW. \(IIP3_2 = 10^{25/10} = 316.2\)~mW.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{derivationsteps}
        \step \textbf{Calculate the cascaded Noise Figure using the Friis Formula.}
        \[ F_{\text{total}} = F_1 + \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1} = 1.41 + \frac{3.98 - 1}{100} = 1.41 + 0.0298 = 1.44 \]
        \[ NF_{\text{total}} = 10\log_{10}(1.44) = \mathbf{1.58~\text{dB}} \]
        As expected, the total NF is dominated by the LNA's NF.

        \step \textbf{Calculate the cascaded Input IP3.} The formula for cascaded IIP3 is:
        \[ \frac{1}{IIP3_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{IIP3_1} + \frac{G_1}{IIP3_2} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{100}{316.2} = 0.1 + 0.316 = 0.416 \]
        \[ IIP3_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{0.416} = 2.40~\text{mW} \]
        \[ IIP3_{\text{total}} = 10\log_{10}(2.40) = \mathbf{+3.8~\text{dBm}} \]
    \end{derivationsteps}

    \parhead{Interpretation}
    The total noise figure is excellent, close to that of the LNA. However, the overall linearity, represented by the cascaded IIP3 of +3.8~dBm, is significantly degraded from the individual component values. This is because the high gain of the LNA amplifies signals before they reach the mixer, making the mixer more susceptible to non-linearity. This illustrates the fundamental trade-off in receiver design between sensitivity (low NF) and linearity (high IIP3).
