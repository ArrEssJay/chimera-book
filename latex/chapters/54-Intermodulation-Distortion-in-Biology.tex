\begin{nontechnical}
    \textbf{Intermodulation Distortion (IMD) is what happens when two signals mix together in a "non-linear" medium to create new, phantom signals.} It's like mixing blue and yellow paint to get green—a colour that wasn't present in either of the original inputs.

    \parhead{The radio station analogy}
    Imagine two strong radio stations broadcasting at 100.1 MHz and 100.3 MHz. If you are near the transmitter, your car radio's electronics might be overwhelmed. This non-linearity can cause the two signals to mix, creating a phantom signal at their difference frequency (0.2 MHz away from the originals) that interferes with the station at 100.5 MHz.

    \parhead{Relevance to biology}
    This raises a fascinating question: can biological tissue itself act as a non-linear mixer?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Acoustic Waves (Ultrasound): YES.} Tissue is highly non-linear to sound waves. This is a well-established fact and is the basis for \emph{harmonic imaging} in medical ultrasound, a technique used daily in hospitals worldwide.
        \item \textbf{Electromagnetic Waves (RF/Microwave): LARGELY NO.} Tissue is only very weakly non-linear to electromagnetic fields. The power required to generate a detectable IMD product would be so high that it would cook the tissue long before any significant mixing could occur.
    \end{itemize}

    \parhead{The bottom line}
    While the idea of using two crossed electromagnetic beams to generate a new frequency deep within the brain is an exciting concept for non-invasive neuromodulation, it is considered highly speculative and likely impractical due to the fundamental biophysics of tissue. The non-linearity is simply too weak.

\subsection{Overview}

\keyterm{Intermodulation Distortion (IMD)} is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more signals at different frequencies pass through a non-linear system. The system's output contains not only the original frequencies but also new, unwanted signals at their sum and difference frequencies, as well as other combinations.

In engineering, IMD is typically an undesirable effect in amplifiers and receivers that must be minimised. However, it can also be exploited intentionally, as in the case of a frequency mixer. This chapter explores the potential for biological tissue itself to act as a non-linear medium, and assesses the viability of this effect for both acoustic and electromagnetic waves.

\begin{keyconcept}
    A fundamental asymmetry exists in the non-linear properties of biological tissue. It exhibits \textbf{strong acoustic non-linearity}, which is the basis for established medical technologies like harmonic imaging. In contrast, its \textbf{electromagnetic non-linearity} is exceptionally weak, rendering classical EM intermodulation a negligible effect at physiologically safe power levels.
\end{keyconcept}


\subsection{Sources of Non-linearity in Tissue}

\paragraph{Acoustic Non-linearity}
The primary source of acoustic non-linearity is the non-linear relationship between pressure and density in a fluid-like medium, as described by the \keyterm{parameter of non-linearity, $\beta$}. For soft tissues, $\beta \approx 5-10$, which is a significant value that leads to robust harmonic generation and wave mixing. This is a well-understood and clinically exploited phenomenon.

\paragraph{Electromagnetic Non-linearity}
The sources of EM non-linearity in tissue are far weaker.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dielectric Non-linearity (Kerr Effect):} The refractive index of water (the main component of tissue) changes slightly with the intensity of an electric field. This is governed by the third-order susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$, which is on the order of $10^{-22}$ m$^2$/V$^2$ for tissue—about 1,000 times weaker than in a typical non-linear crystal.
    \item \textbf{Membrane Non-linearity:} The voltage-gated ion channels in a neuron's membrane have a highly non-linear response to changes in transmembrane potential. However, the cell membrane acts as a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency in the Hz to kHz range, effectively shielding the channels from direct interaction with RF and microwave fields.
\end{itemize}

\begin{warningbox}
    The extremely weak electromagnetic non-linearity of tissue is the central obstacle to any proposed application based on classical EM intermodulation. Theoretical calculations consistently show that the intensity required to produce a detectable IMD product would be many orders of magnitude above established safety limits and would cause immediate thermal damage.
\end{warningbox}


\subsection{Comparison of Biological Demodulation Phenomena}

It is crucial to distinguish between true intermodulation and other non-linear effects.
