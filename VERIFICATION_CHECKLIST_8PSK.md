# Verification Checklist: 8PSK Chapter Visual Fixes

## How to Verify

### 1. Compile the Chapter
```bash
cd _latex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode test_8psk.tex
```

### 2. Check Compilation Output
Look for these in the log:
- [ ] No "Overfull \hbox" warnings
- [ ] No "Overfull \vbox" warnings  
- [ ] No undefined reference errors
- [ ] Successful PDF generation

### 3. Visual Inspection of PDF

#### Page 1: Constellation Diagram
- [ ] All 8 constellation point labels are clearly visible
- [ ] No overlap between labels at 45°, 135°, 225°, 315° positions
- [ ] Angular spacing annotation "45°" is readable and not overlapping with point
- [ ] Diagram is centered on page
- [ ] Diagram fits within margins (not cut off)

#### Page 2-3: Block Diagrams

**Transmitter Diagram:**
- [ ] All blocks visible and not cut off at right margin
- [ ] Block labels are readable (not compressed)
- [ ] Connection arrows don't cross blocks
- [ ] LO labels below mixers are visible
- [ ] Entire diagram width < page width

**Receiver Diagram:**
- [ ] All 7 stages fit on page without overflow
- [ ] Block labels for "Lowpass Filter" and "Sample @T_s" are readable
- [ ] Decision block connects properly to both I and Q paths
- [ ] LO labels are not overlapping with mixers
- [ ] Right side output "Data 3 bits" is visible

#### Throughout Document

**Tables:**
- [ ] Gray coding table (lines 133-147) is centered
- [ ] BER comparison tables are centered and aligned
- [ ] Parameter table in worked example is centered

**Callout Boxes:**
- [ ] "Efficiency Trade-off" title fits in box header
- [ ] "8PSK Phase Noise Requirement" renders properly
- [ ] "DVB-S2 Throughput Example" fits in box
- [ ] "Link Budget Result" box displays correctly

**Equations:**
- [ ] All equations are centered
- [ ] No equation extends past right margin
- [ ] Subscripts and superscripts are legible

**Text Flow:**
- [ ] No awkward line breaks mid-equation
- [ ] Paragraphs justify cleanly
- [ ] No orphaned lines

### 4. Comparison with Other Chapters
- [ ] Diagram sizes consistent with QPSK chapter
- [ ] Spacing matches style of other modulation chapters
- [ ] Typography consistent throughout book

## Quick Visual Test

Open the PDF and scan for:
1. **Red flag**: Any text or graphic cut off at page edge
2. **Red flag**: Overlapping text on diagrams
3. **Red flag**: Compressed or unreadable labels
4. **Red flag**: Boxes with titles running outside borders

## Expected Results

✅ **PASS Criteria:**
- Clean compilation with no warnings
- All diagrams fit within page margins
- No overlapping elements
- Professional, readable appearance

❌ **FAIL Indicators:**
- Overfull hbox warnings
- Cut-off diagrams or text
- Overlapping labels
- Compressed or illegible text

## Notes

The fixes focused on:
1. **Scale reduction** in constellation diagram (2.2 → 2.0)
2. **Spacing optimization** in block diagrams (2.8cm → 2.5cm average)
3. **Label positioning** to prevent overlap (2-4pt → 3-5pt)
4. **Title shortening** to fit callout boxes

These are conservative changes that maintain visual quality while ensuring proper layout within the 7×10 inch format with 0.875in side margins.
